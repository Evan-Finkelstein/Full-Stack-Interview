You have 24 hours from the receipt of this document to:

- Write the code to complete the challenge
- Push it up to a repository in GitHub or BitBucket
- Send us the url to the repository.

We expect to be able to clone the repository, examine, and run your working code.

## The Challenge

Create a responsive frontend with user registration, user login, and a user profile page. Included in this repository is a design mockup for registration/login that includes a Figma file and PDF.

You can use the mockup as a guide for the design of the frontend. You can use any framework or library you want to build the frontend. You can use any backend framework or library you want to build the backend. You can use any database you want to store the user data but would recommend using SQLite.

## Tips

- Do your best to impress us, your code run through prettier and eslint may help.
- Attention to detail is important.

## Bonus Points

- Use VueJS for the frontend
- Use Go for the backend
- Tests for frontend and backend
